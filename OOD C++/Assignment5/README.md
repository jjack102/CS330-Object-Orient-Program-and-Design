# Implementing Inheritance and Iterators - Vectors
I worked on the Composite class. This code defines the Composite class for managing composite 
polyhedra that consist of multiple individual polyhedra. The Composite class provides methods for 
adding, cloning, reading, displaying, and scaling collections of polyhedra. It is designed to work 
as part of a hierarchy involving other polyhedron shapes, as indicated by the inheritance from 
Polyhedron.
