# Implementing C++ Iterators - Vectors and Lists
I worked on the Schedule class. This updated version of the Schedule class offers
greater flexibility by allowing you to choose between different container types and provides more 
convenient member functions for managing and interacting with course schedules. Additionally, it
improves the organization of the code by using class constants and default implementations for 
constructors and assignment operators.
# Implementing Pointer to Object Type
I worked on Student class. This code defines a Student class that can be used to represent students, manage their names and schedules, and enroll them in courses. It also provides utility functions for comparison and display. The Student class is designed to work in conjunction with the Course and Schedule classes.
