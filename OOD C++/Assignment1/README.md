# Implementing ADTs in C++ Classes - Linked List
I implemented changes to the Schedule class. This class provides the basic functionality for
managing course schedules, ensuring that credit limits are not exceeded, and preventing duplicate 
courses in the schedule. It also includes a linked list, copy constructor and assignment operator 
to facilitate object copying and assignment.
