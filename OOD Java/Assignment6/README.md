# Implementing Inheritance in Java
I worked on the Cylinder class. This Cylinder class encapsulates the properties and behaviors of a 
cylinder. It inherits from the Polyhedron class, which suggests that it's part of a hierarchy of 
3D geometric shapes. The class provides methods to manipulate and display cylinder-specific 
properties, such as its height and radius.
