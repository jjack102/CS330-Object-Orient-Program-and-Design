# Implementing C++ Iterators - Vector and Lists
I worked on the Schedule class. This code provides a more flexible Schedule class that allows you 
to choose between two container types (std::list or std::vector) for storing courses. It maintains 
the same functionality for managing course schedules, enforcing credit limits, and preventing 
duplicate courses as the previous version.
